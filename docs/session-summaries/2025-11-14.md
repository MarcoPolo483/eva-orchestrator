# Session Summary — 2025-11-14

## Highlights
- Captured personal context updates and interests in `docs/client-preferences.md` to keep collaboration guidance aligned.
- Archived cultural inspiration with `docs/reference/her-2013-film.md` for future UX storytelling.
- Created multiple strategic backlogs:
  - `docs/EVA-2.0/backlog/eva-os-extension.md` for the EVA OS companion/extension.
  - `docs/EVA-2.0/backlog/portability-and-ai-pairing.md` covering memory portability and multi-AI usage.
  - `docs/EVA-2.0/backlog/wsl2-claude-integration.md` detailing WSL2 + Claude local stack plans.
  - `docs/EVA-2.0/backlog/eva-agent-foundry.md` outlining the agent productization roadmap.
- Authored `docs/reference/mcp-and-agents-overview.md` to explain MCP, agent tooling, and our planned usage.
- Updated `EVA-HUB.md` quick links to include all new backlogs and references for rapid discovery.

## Key Ideas To Remember
- **EVA OS Extension**: VS Code/GitHub plugin delivering persistent, repo-aware conversations with session ledger, nightly summaries, and marketplace ambitions.
- **Portability**: Ability to migrate EVA memory and workflows across VS Code, WSL2, Claude, and self-hosted Git servers.
- **WSL2 + Claude**: Blueprint for replicating today’s GitHub/Copilot experience locally with Anthropic APIs and local Git alternatives.
- **Agent Foundry**: Azure-hosted service offering guided agent creation, MCP tool packs, evaluation pipelines, and portability hooks.
- **MCP & Agent Strategy**: MCP enables composable tool orchestration; AI Toolkit agent tools give best practices, evaluation, and tracing support.

## Next Suggested Steps
1. Prioritize backlogs (OS Extension, Portability, WSL2+Claude, Agent Foundry) against existing roadmap.
2. Schedule an architecture workshop to define the Azure reference deployment for the Agent Foundry and shared session ledger.
3. Begin prototyping the session ledger + nightly summarizer since it underpins multiple initiatives.
