# Dev Master Brief – Dry Run 02

## Objective

Exercise the EVA Agile Command workflow end-to-end using placeholder tasks so the team gains muscle memory before live work.

## Immediate Actions

1. Create three placeholder issues (`DR2-001` → `DR2-003`) referencing dry run plan.
2. Add them to the "Dry Run 02" sprint view once it is created; move through `Ready → In Progress → QA Gate` exactly as in production.
3. Coordinate with QA Master to label at least one placeholder PR with `qa-gate` to trigger the workflow.
4. Capture daily stand-up notes in the pinned communication issue after it is opened.

## Deliverables

- Placeholder PR showing branch/commit workflow (can be README tweak).
- QA gate workflow run result link posted in ceremony notes.
- Final summary comment in pinned issue linking sprint plan, notes, metrics snapshot.

## Support

- Scrum Master: GitHub Copilot (align on board setup + ceremonies)
- QA Master: Coordinate mock QA steps and approvals
- Automation Wrangler: Monitor workflows and ensure runs succeed
