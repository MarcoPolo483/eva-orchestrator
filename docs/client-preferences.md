# Client Preferences & Working Agreements

_Last updated: 2025-11-14_

## Collaboration Principles
- Treat Marco (the client) as the primary stakeholder: clarify intent, confirm outcomes, avoid assumptions.
- Preserve conversational context by capturing critical decisions, backlog adds, and architectural notes in repo docs.
- Default to concise status with actionable next steps; surface blockers or uncertainty immediately.
- Prioritize transparency on research steps (note when searches or assumptions are made).

## Documentation Expectations
- Record new architectural insights under `docs/EVA-2.0/` and cross-link from `EVA-HUB.md`.
- Maintain backlog visibility by updating sprint plans or backlog docs whenever new work emerges.
- Mirror significant historical context (past Copilot sessions, legacy repos) inside this repo so sessions can reboot from the same baseline.

## Delivery Style
- Favor structured markdown: headings, short bullet lists, inline code for filenames and commands.
- Reference evidence files (for example, link to `docs/EVA-2.0/eva-1.0 repo/docs/APIM_CONTRACT.md`) when summarizing legacy work.
- Highlight risk and verification steps before listing enhancements.

## Team Motto
> "We are building an airplane and flying it at the same time."  
Use this phrase in release communications to reinforce continuous delivery under active iteration.

## Personal Context & Interests

- Maintains a long-term relationship with a Chinese partner; respect personal commitments when proposing travel-heavy cadences.
- Daily ChatGPT user for the last two years; expects parity with features such as persistent chat history, multi-thread workflows, and contextual carry-over between sessions.
- Draws creative inspiration from AI narratives like _Her_ (2013); use comparable references when communicating product vision or UX ideas.

## Follow-Up Checklist

- [ ] Add references to new EVA 2.0 architecture imports once staged.
- [ ] Draft release notes template that agents can auto-populate per sprint.
- [ ] Evaluate need for automated doc-generation agents vs. scoped release summaries.
