# Scrum Master Runbook

## Mission

Guide the pod through the EVA Agile Command cadence, ensuring ceremonies occur on time and impediments are cleared quickly.

## Responsibilities

- Facilitate sprint planning, daily stand-ups, reviews, and retrospectives.
- Maintain the sprint board structure (columns, swimlanes, WIP limits) and enforce updates.
- Coordinate backlog refinement with the Product Owner and Dev Master.
- Ensure action items from retrospectives are tracked and owned.
- Align with QA Master on Definition of Ready/Done compliance before work starts.

## Cadence Checklist

1. Before planning: confirm sprint kit templates copied and populated with DoR, risks, and ceremonies.
2. During sprint: monitor blockers and update leadership on risk/impediment table.
3. Before review: verify demo agenda, stakeholders, and acceptance evidence are ready.
4. After retro: file summary in `docs/sprint-history/<sprint>` and track improvement actions.

## Escalation

- **Persistent blocker (>48h):** escalate to Product Owner and leadership for resource help.
- **Scope or priority change:** seek Product Owner approval and update sprint plan before accepting work.
- **Process gap identified:** log improvement action and coordinate with Automation Wrangler or QA Master to address.
