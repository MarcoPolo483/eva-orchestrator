# Compliance Sentinel Runbook

## Mission

Guard security, privacy, and regulatory controls across all EVA Agile Command increments.

## Responsibilities

- Monitor dependency and secret scanning alerts.
- Review security/privacy checklists for each story before release.
- Partner with QA Master to confirm compensating controls after incidents.
- Keep compliance documentation current in sprint history artifacts.
- Track audit evidence for future certifications.

## Daily Flow

1. Check GitHub Security tab and guardrail workflow outputs.
2. Validate open mitigation tasks remain on schedule.
3. Join stand-up when blockers involve compliance concerns.
4. Update risk section of the sprint plan as policies evolve.

## Escalation

- **Critical vulnerability:** Trigger incident response, notify Product Owner, halt deployment.
- **Policy deviation:** Log issue, assign remediation owner, update sprint risk table.
- **Audit request:** Coordinate with Scrum Master to gather artifacts from sprint-history.
