This repository is a portable profile and project context export for Marco Presta.
It is designed so another AI engine (or future you) can quickly understand:

- Who Marco is (personal and professional).
- What EVA is and where it’s going.
- The key projects, initiatives, and personal experiments currently in flight.
- How Marco prefers to work with AI and consume outputs.

All files are JSON to make them easy to ingest programmatically.

## Structure

- `profile/identity_and_background.json`  
  Core identity, location, education, and career background.

- `profile/professional_profile_and_projects.json`  
  High-level professional profile and an overview list of major initiatives.

- `profile/preferences_and_interaction_style.json`  
  How Marco likes to work, communicate, and use AI assistants.

- `profile/personal_interests_and_lifestyle.json`  
  Health, relationships, hobbies, and intellectual interests.

- `profile/values_and_meta_goals.json`  
  Core values, principles, and short/long-term AI usage goals.

- `profile/eva_suite_2_0_architecture.json`  
  Snapshot of the EVA Suite 2.0 architecture, components, and governance patterns.

- `profile/conversation_history_index.json`  
  Timeline/chapters of major topics covered in past AI conversations.

- `profile/professional_projects_dossiers.json`  
  One-card dossiers for each major professional project (EVA, Jurisprudence, AssistMe, etc.).

- `profile/personal_projects_dossiers.json`  
  One-card dossiers for personal projects (relationship, health, gardening, DIY, etc.).

- `profile/workflow_templates.json`  
  Reusable templates for PRDs, work plan items, AI software assessments, RACI, and RAID/RAIDE.

## How Another AI Engine Can Use This

1. **Load all JSON files** at startup into its long-term memory or vector store.  
2. **Index by `id` and `name`** so prompts like “Update EVA DA 2.0 plan” can map to the right project.  
3. **Respect preferences** in `preferences_and_interaction_style.json` when formatting responses.  
4. **Use values & goals** to bias suggestions (e.g., emphasize governance, accessibility, bilingualism).  
5. **Cross-link personal and professional projects** to support holistic coaching (e.g., time management, work–life balance).

## Suggested Next Additions (Optional)

- `meeting_summaries/` – Key decisions and action items from major EVA/BDM/AI governance meetings.
- `prompts_playbook.json` – Example prompts Marco uses often (for drafting emails, PRDs, code scaffolding, etc.).
- `roadmaps/` – High-level roadmaps for EVA 2.0, IIAID, and major integrations.

For now, this v1 focuses on **foundational identity + project context + workflows**.
It should be enough for a new AI assistant to get up to speed quickly.
