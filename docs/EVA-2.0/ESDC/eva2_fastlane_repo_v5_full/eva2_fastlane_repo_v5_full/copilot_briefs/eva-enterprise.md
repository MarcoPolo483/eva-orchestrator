- README linking fastlane demo to enterprise EVA vision and governance.

## Tasks for You (Copilot)

1. Assess the current state of this repo against the Definition of Done.
2. Generate/refactor code and docs to reach minimum readiness.
3. Prefer simple, explicit, well-documented solutions.
4. Add or update a short `STATUS.md` summarizing what is implemented and what remains.
