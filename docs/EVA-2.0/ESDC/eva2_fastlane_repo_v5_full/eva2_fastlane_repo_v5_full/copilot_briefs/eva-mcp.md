# Copilot Brief – eva-mcp

## Context

You are helping build **EVA 2.0**, a modular AI platform.
This brief is specifically about the **`eva-mcp`** repo.

Before you start, skim:

- `docs/architecture_overview.md`
- `docs/fastlane_demo_scope.md`
- `docs/api_eva_api_contract.md` (if API-related)
- `docs/ui_templates_and_assets.md` (if UI-related)
- `plans/minimum_readiness_matrix.md` (section for `eva-mcp`)

## Role of this repo

Model Context Protocol integration for EVA tools (future).

## Priority for Fastlane Demo

**LOW**

## Minimum Demo Readiness – Definition of Done

For the fastlane demo, this repo is ready when:

- README explaining how EVA tools would be exposed via MCP and sample tool spec.

## Tasks for You (Copilot)

1. Assess the current state of this repo against the Definition of Done.
2. Generate/refactor code and docs to reach minimum readiness.
3. Prefer simple, explicit, well-documented solutions.
4. Add or update a short `STATUS.md` summarizing what is implemented and what remains.
